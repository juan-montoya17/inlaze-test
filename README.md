## Installation

To install the project, we need to have installed the following tools:

- Node.js in the latest version üü¢

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can install the latest version [here](https://nodejs.org/es/)

#### Step 1

Clone the project

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/juan-montoya17/inlaze-test.git
```

#### Step 2

Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

#### Step 3

Create the `.env` file. Then, copy the data from `.env.example` file and paste it in the `.env` file. Finally, give values to the environment variables for the development environment.

#### Step 4

Run the database with Docker and Docker-compose üêã

If you don't have Docker installed, you can install it following
the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

<blockquote>
<span>
üí°
</span>
<span>
If you install Docker Desktop (on Windows and Mac), it comes with docker compose, but if you install it on Linux you must install it separately.
</span>
</blockquote>

Raise the Docker container that runs the database, by executing the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d postgres
```

#### Step 5

Run the app

```bash
# normal mode
$ npm run start
```

```bash
# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```

```bash
# debug mode
$ npm run start:debug
```

#### Step 6

If the tha app is running correctly, you can see the main route response in the browser, by clicking on the first link
that appears in the terminal.
